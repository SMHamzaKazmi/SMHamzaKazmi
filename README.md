I’m a Computer Science graduate with experience in software development. I have hands-on experience in .NET development, specializing in building scalable applications using C#, .NET Core, .NET Framework, ASP.NET Core and WPF. I’ve also worked with languages like Python, Java, SQL, and web development languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Angular. I have worked on NCache, an In-Memory Distributed Cache for .NET, contributing to feature development and multiple product releases in a Scrum-based environment.

My background includes helping teams solve technical problems, improve system performance, and support users effectively. I enjoy learning new technologies and applying them to real-world challenges. I’m looking for opportunities where I can grow as a developer and contribute to projects that make a difference.
